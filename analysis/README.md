Generate_cluster_information_file:
Generates a pkl file with information about the clusters present in each image, including number of clusters, size and intensity of each one.

Threshold helper:
Visualization tool used to understand the effect of different intensity threshold values in determining which clusters in an image are detected as galaxies.

Analysis patches and positions:
Notebook containing two experiments: one to analyse how the position of the
patches influences the score and one to analyse how the choice of patches
influences the score. 

FFT visualize:
